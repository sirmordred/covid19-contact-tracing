    \n\nThese notifications are designed to notify you if you\’ve been exposed to COVID-19.
    \n\nExposure notifications rely on the sharing and collecting of random IDs. These IDs are a random string of numbers that won\'t identify you to other users and change many times a day to protect your privacy.
    \n\nYour device will collect and share random IDs with nearby devices. This app can notify you if you\'ve been near someone who has reported a positive COVID-19 test result.
    \n\nIf you test positive for COVID-19, you can also help your community by reporting your test result.
    \n\nIf you’re exposed, the time, approximate date, and distance of your exposure are shared with this app. This helps health experts better understand the spread of COVID-19. These details aren’t associated with your random IDs to protect your privacy.
